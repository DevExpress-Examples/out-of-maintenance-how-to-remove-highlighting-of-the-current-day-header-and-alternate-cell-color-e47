# How to remove highlighting of the current day header and alternate cell color


## Problem

By default my SchedulerControl is displayed as follows:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-remove-highlighting-of-the-current-day-header-and-alternate-cell-color-e4747/12.2.10+/media/674ed945-18f2-4540-9432-77980e02da12.png">

Note that the current day header and worktime cell area are highlighted. I want to disable this highlighting for all views. 

## Solution

These elements are rendered according to the alternate styles and background brush selectors accordingly. You can examine the default themes (see the C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 21.1\Components\Sources\DevExpress.Xpf.Scheduler\DevExpress.Xpf.Scheduler\Themes folder) to see how this is implemented. You can override them as shown in this example. The result should be as follows:
